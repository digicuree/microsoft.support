Microsoft Professional Support is the official fee-based technical support team of the company. It is primarily targeted at business users like yourself.

So, if your computer or network is having problems, you can contact them and they will work to recommend ways to resolve the issue -- usually through Microsoft chat support.

## What problems do they address? What do they not address?

**Microsoft Support** will attempt to help you with all of your requests but within certain parameters. These include:

1. **Customer proposals for product features:** Microsoft will not help you develop new features you want on your programs
Writing or review of custom code: Similar to the point above, Microsoft will not review changes your business has made to program or operating system code.
2. **Products out of support lifecycle:** Microsoft will not help you with products that are no longer being supported. For example, if your Word 2007 malfunctions, the team of experts will not help restore functionality.
3. **Onsite support:** This is a crucial point. Microsoft does not offer onsite help. That means no one will come to do the physical work on your computer or network. You will be given advice online or over the phone.
4. Root cause analysis: Another very crucial point. Microsoft will attempt to address your immediate needs concerning the issue, but it will not look for the deeper root cause of your problem.
